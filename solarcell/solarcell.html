    <h2>About Solar Panels<br></h2>
    <p>Solar cells, also known as photovoltaic celss, are devices that convert sunlight directly into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. 
        The basic building block of a solar cell is a semiconductor material, typically made of crystalline silicon. 
        The semiconductor material is doped to create two regions with different electrical properties:  
        the <strong>p-type (positive)</strong> and <strong>-n-type (negative)</strong> sides.
        <br><br> When the p-type and n-type semiconductors are joined together, a boundary known as the p-n junction is formed. 
        At this junction, electrons from the n-type material move into the holes of the p-type material, creating an electric field. 
        This creates an internal electric field within the solar cell.
        <br><br> Now, when the <strong>photons</strong> (particles of light) strike the solar cell, they can excite electrons in the semiconductor material. 
        This exication generates electron-hole paris. The electric field at the p-n junction then separates these electron-hole pairs, 
        causing the electrons to move towards the n-type side and the holes towards the p-type side. This movement of charges creates a flow of electrical current.
        <br><br> During normal operation, a solar cell is typically under no external bias or under a very small bias voltage. 
        This is often referred to as the open-circuit condition. When sunlight strikes the solcar cell, as we have said before, electro-hole paris are generates, 
        and the built-in electric field at the p-n junction separates them, causing a flow of current. 
        The voltage that will be generated by the solar cell is influenced by the potential barrier at the p-n juntion and the movement of charge carriers across it. 
        <br><br> The solar cell used in the experiment was the <a href="https://www.pollin.de/p/solarmodul-sm-7546-1-v-0-2-w-590038" target="_blank">Solarmodul SM-7546</a>.

    <h2>Additional tools</h2>
        <p>For our experiment, we connected our solar cell to a <a href="https://lampz.tugraz.at/~hadley/semi/ch9/instruments/Keithley26xx/Keithley26xx.php" target="_blank">
            Keithley 2636A Series Sourcemeter</a> 
            which was used as a voltage supply, and as a current measurement tool,
            so we could see in the display screen the voltage that was running through our solar cell (data will be shown after).

        <p>Then we introduce the solar cell inside the  <a href="https://lampz.tugraz.at/~hadley/semi/ch9/instruments/VT4002/index.php" target="_blank">
            Vötsch VT4002 climate chamber</a> 
            to measure the performance of the solar cell
            under different temperatures and see how this affects the I/V relationship.</p>

             <p>The sourcemeter was connected to the solar cell using jumper wires on a classical breadboard. 
                Voltage across the electrodes was swept from negative to positive values for different current ranges to get the best precision of measurements.
                We repeated this process at different temperatures and a different exposures of light. To see how the exposure of light and temperature  
                over the solar cell affected the I/V relationship. </p>

    <h2>Measurement</h2>
    <p>Our study is expressly governed by the data obtained when the solar plate was introduced 
        into the climate chamber under conditions of exposure of light and darkness.  
        Then for each light exposure we study the temperature dependence.
        <h3>No light exposure results</h3>
        <p>Once the solar cell is connected to the sourcemeter and introduced inside the climate chamber, 
            we convered the window of the chamber to simulate complete darkness.

        <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="IV_dark.png" height="500" width="700"> </div>
        <div style="text-align: center;"> <p> IV-curve without light exposure</p> </div>
            <p>As we can see in our plot, there is no power production, this is because the solar cell relies on the absorption of photons (light) to generate
                electron-hole pairs and create a voltage potential across the cell. So, as we don't have any photons to initiate the process, as a result no electro-hole
                pairs are generated and therefore no voltage potential across the cell.
            </p>
        <h3>Light exposure results</h3>
            <p>This time we did not cover the climate chamber window, instead we placed a fixed light source in front of the climate chamber window. This source of light
                was maintained over the time until the climate chamber reached 40ºC. So this time there are two different sources that are hitting the solar cell, 
                light and increasing temperature. <a href="solar_T.py" target="_blank">Python script</a>   used for the plot.

<p> The results for the light exposed solar cell is that the maximum power decreases with temperature, as is shown in the plot below. It also shows that the voltage at the maximum power point decreases whereas the current stays almost constant. As a result of the light exposure and the temperature increase in a reverse bias condition, the photocurrent becomes the dominant current source
                The offset created by the photocurrent pushes the I-V characteristic of the cell into the fourth quadrant, meaning that for positive voltages, 
                the current sign is negative, thus the solar cell is producing power, and this only happens in the 4th quadrant.
                We have obtained three different values for each temperature and with a fixed light source over the solar cell: the short-circuit current, 
                <strong>I<sub>sc</sub></strong> (where V=0), the open circuit voltage, <strong>V<sub>0C</sub></strong> (where I=0), and the point where the cell produces maximal power.
                From the figure above we have obtained all these values for different temperatures and we have represented them graphically 
                with the corresponding temperature values to see how they respond to a temperature increase in the plot below.<br><br>

                <div style="text-align: center;"> <p> Max Power, P, Current, I, Voltage, V, obtaines values through the temperature variation with light exposure</p> </div>

The solar cell is producing energy since the product of current and voltage is negative. The maximum power generated is reduced as the temperature increases, 
                this is due to the temperature dependence of the reverse saturation current (<strong>I<sub>0</sub></strong>) in the diode equation which is exponential
                with temperature. As the temperature increases, I<sub>0</sub> also increases. The increase in the reverse saturation current contributes to a higher 
                reverse saturation current in the solar cell, even in the absence of light. In consequence, the open-circuit voltage will be reduced, which is a key factor 
                in determining the maximum power output.

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>The maximum power of the solar cell decreases with temperature. By studying the IV 4th quadrant graph, one may notice that the open circuit voltage, 
                <strong>V<sub>0C</sub></strong>,
                (voltage at I<sub>tot</sub>=0, i.e. the amount of forward bias on solar cell due to bias of the solar cell junction with light generated current) is 
                decreasing the most (voltage is the main contributor to decrease in P). The equation for the open-circuit voltage is
                <div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="equation.png" height="40" width="175"> </div>
                Where <strong>n</strong> is the ideality factor or diode factor, representing deviations from the ideal behavior of a diode. It is often between 1 and 2, 
                <strong>k<sub>B</sub></strong> is the Boltzmann constant, <strong>T</strong> is the temperature measured in kelvins, <strong>e</strong> is the elementary
                charge, <strong>I<sub>L</sub></strong> is the light-generated current, the current produced by the solar cell when illuminated, and 
                <strong>I<sub>0</sub></strong> is the reverse saturation current, a parameter related to the leakage current in the absence of light.<br>
                It seems that V<sub>0C</sub> should increase linearly with the temperature, but this is not the case as I<sub>0</sub> increases rapidly with temperature, 
                primarly due to changes in intrinsic carrier concentration n<sub>i</sub>. 

<p>Using data for dark conditions, it is possible to find the saturation current for each temperature, 
                I<sub>0</sub>, by using the Shockley diode equation and extrapoling a line that crosses the 0 voltage point. The plot below shows the result for 20ºC.

                <div style="text-align: center;"> <p> Extrapolation to find I<sub>0</sub> for 20ºC </p> </div>

                By doing this for different temperatures, it is found that the saturation current increases with temperature, which was expected. <br><br>
                Once we have calculated <strong>n</strong> from the formula above and using that the light generated current (<strong>I<sub>L</sub></strong>) is approximately equal to
                the short-circuit current (<strong>I<sub>sc</sub></strong>), (<strong>I<sub>L</sub>=I<sub>sc</sub></strong>), V<sub>0C</sub> can be plotted for different temperatures, 
                which shows the decrease with temperature, which is the same trend achieved in the experiment. This is shown in the plot below.

<div style="text-align: center;"> <img src="V_oc_T.png" height="500" width="700"> </div>
                <div style="text-align: center;"> <p> V<sub>0C</sub> for different temperatures </p> </div>

 The light generated current, <strong>I<sub>L</sub></strong>, in a solar cell, it is represented
                by the equation <strong>I<sub>L</sub>=AeG<sub>L</sub>W</strong>, where <strong>A</strong> is the solar cell area, which is the effective surface area of 
                the solar cell exposed to the light, <strong>e</strong> is the elementary charge, <strong>G<sub>L</sub></strong> is the incident light power, often
                expressed as the solar irradiance or the amount of light falling on the solar cell per unit area, and <strong>W</strong> is the width of the solar cell, 
                representing the dimension of the solar cell in the direction perpendicular to the flow of light.
                So the depletion width decreases with temperature, as charge carriers density increases. 
                This also leads to a decrease in the open-circuit voltage, although the change is not as big.
